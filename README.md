# MageCore

## A simple 2D roguelike game made in unity.

## **History of Production**
The game was made during my first year studying game development and design at Södertörns Högskola.
The game took around three weeks to make, mainly due to a loose schedule.
The game was made with a couple of classmates and isn't a solo dev piece. However all the code and vfx are made by me and one more.

## **Coding**
As previously mentioned the code was done by me and one other person.
My particular job was to work on the character movement, input- and attack system.
I also did some other misc tasks that will be mentioned in the graphic sections

## **Graphics**
All assets are made by other people that worked on the project.
I however did most of the lighting.
I also made misc scripts for pulsating- and changing lights.
I also designed and implemented the ui for the tooltips.
